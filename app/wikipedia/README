Trove matching module for Wikipedia

This is a matching module: a module which evaluates objects in the trove
against some external source. In this case, the external source is Wikipedia,
by way of dbpedialite:

    http://dbpedialite.org/

dbpedialite is used over dbpedia because of URI persistence â€” dbpedia URIs
change when Wikipedia page titles do, whereas dbpedialite uses the Wikipedia
page identifier, which persists across renames and so on.

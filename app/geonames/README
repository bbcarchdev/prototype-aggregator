Trove matching module for geonames.

This is a matching module: a module which evaluates objects in the trove
against some external source. In this case, the external source is Geonames:

    http://www.geonames.org/

Rather than using the geonames web service directly, this module maintains
a local version of the data for performing lookups against, but URIs that
are generated are within the http://sws.geonames.org/ namespace.

This is a metaproject for the DPS aggregator. Once you've checked it out, you'll
need to initialise and update the submodules:

$ git submodule update --init

Next, create a placeholder configuration:

$ ./cli install

When prompted, enter 'dps-aggregator' as the application name. Other defaults
should be fine.

Next, modify config/config.<instance-name>.php to suit your setup. 

You should uncomment the line which reads:

/* define('TROVE_IRI', 'mysql://username:password@localhost/trove'); */

And modify the database URI to suit your configuration. You will need to
create an empty database which the specified credentials are able to access,
but you don't need to create any tables. To do that, run:

$ ./cli setup

You may also wish to enable more verbose output when errors occur by adding
the following to your config/config.<instance-name>.php:

define('EREGANSU_DEBUG', true);

Finally, you should configure your web server to expose the application. The
'public' directory is the virtual host's document root. Sample configuration
is provided near the end of the 'install' script, but you may wish to adjust
this (in particular, the default configuration uses public/.htaccess to
specify the rules for mod_rewrite, but you may prefer to specify "AllowOverride
none" and move these rules into the virtual host configuration instead).
